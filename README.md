# Lab 1: Deep Learning 

## Project Overview

Welcome to **Lab 1: Deep Learning Unleashed**, my submission for the Deep Learning course! This project showcases two killer applications of neural networks:

- **Regression**: Predicting NYSE stock closing prices using a DNN, with regularization to keep overfitting in check.
- **Classification**: Detecting machine failures with a DNN classifier, optimized via grid search and beefed up with dropout.

Built with **PyTorch** on Google Colab, this repo is a testament to data wrangling, model crafting, and performance tuningâ€”all in one slick Jupyter Notebook.

## Features

-  **NYSE Regression**: Predicts stock prices using a 3-layer DNN (3-64-32-1) with ReLU and dropout.
-  **Maintenance Classification**: Classifies machine failures (binary) with a tuned DNN (7-64-32-2).
-  **Data Viz**: Histograms, scatter plots, loss/MAE/accuracy curvesâ€”visuals that pop!
-  **Regularization**: Dropout (0.2) and weight decay (0.01) to fight overfitting like a boss.
-  **GPU Power**: Leverages CUDA for lightning-fast training.
-  **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search over learning rates and optimizers for peak performance.

## Usage

### 1. Open the Notebook:
- Fire up **lab1_deep_learning.ipynb** in Jupyter or upload it to Google Colab
### 2. Run It:
- Hit **Run All** (or `Shift + Enter` cell-by-cell) to:
  - ðŸ“¥ Download datasets via **kagglehub**.
  - ðŸ”„ Preprocess, train, and evaluate both models.
  - ðŸ“Š Generate dope plots.

### 3. Outputs:
- Check inline plots (loss, MAE, accuracy) and printed metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, F1-score).

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip**: Got a **GPU**? Colabâ€™s free CUDA support will make this fly!

## Results

NYSE Regression
 -  Task: Predict closing prices from open, high, and low.
 -  Model: DNN (3-64-32-1) + ReLU + Dropout (0.2).
 -  Loss: MSE dropped from 12,062 to 16.55 (regularized) over 100 epochs.
 -  MAE: Slashed to ~4.0 on test set with regularization.
 -  Takeaway: Dropout and weight decay crushed overfittingâ€”test loss stayed tight!

**Maintenance Classification**   
 -  Task: Predict machine failure (Target: 0 or 1).
 -  Model: DNN (7-64-32-2) + ReLU + Dropout (0.2).
 -  Best Params: lr=0.01, optimizer=adam (via grid search).
 -  Metrics:
     -  Accuracy: 95.47%
     -  Sensitivity: 96.84%
     -  F1 Score: 95.53%
     -  Takeaway: SMOTE balanced the classes, and regularization kept generalization solid.
